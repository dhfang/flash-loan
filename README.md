# flash-loan

An educational exercise where we create an aave flash loan contract and execute it in a test environment in order to better understand 
smart contracts, dexes, and lending protocols.  
We will first create a flash loan contract to take advantage of an artificially created arbitrage opportunity between two dexes.  
Will potentially follow up by creating a contract to execute some sort of flash loan attack.
